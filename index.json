Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows (thousands of parallel branches running on different systems).\nGit was originally authored by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for development of the Linux kernel, with other kernel developers contributing to its initial development. Since 2005, Junio Hamano has been the core maintainer. As with most other distributed version control systems, and unlike most client–server systems, every Git directory on every computer is a full-fledged repository with complete history and full version-tracking abilities, independent of network access or a central server. Git is free and open-source software distributed under the GPL-2.0-only license.\nHistory Git development began in April 2005, after many developers of the Linux kernel gave up access to BitKeeper, a proprietary source-control management (SCM) system that they had been using to maintain the project since 2002.The copyright holder of BitKeeper, Larry McVoy, had withdrawn free use of the product after claiming that Andrew Tridgell had created SourcePuller by reverse engineering the BitKeeper protocols.The same incident also spurred the creation of another version-control system, Mercurial.\nLinus Torvalds wanted a distributed system that he could use like BitKeeper, but none of the available free systems met his needs. Torvalds cited an example of a source-control management system needing 30 seconds to apply a patch and update all associated metadata, and noted that this would not scale to the needs of Linux kernel development, where synchronizing with fellow maintainers could require 250 such actions at once. For his design criterion, he specified that patching should take no more than three seconds, and added three more goals.\nDesign Git’s design was inspired by BitKeeper and Monotone. Git was originally designed as a low-level version-control system engine, on top of which others could write front ends, such as Cogito or StGIT.The core Git project has since become a complete version-control system that is usable directly. While strongly influenced by BitKeeper, Torvalds deliberately avoided conventional approaches, leading to a unique design.\n","date":1656087170,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1656087170,"objectID":"4b21d5dcf3e4ccbf5460b69b359a5446","permalink":"https://example.com/post/git/","publishdate":"2022-06-24T19:12:50+03:00","relpermalink":"/post/git/","section":"post","summary":"Post about git","tags":[],"title":"Git","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":" Overview LaTeX (/ˈlɑːtɛx/ LAH-tekh or /ˈleɪtɛx/ LAY-tekh, is a software system for document preparation. When writing, the writer uses plain text as opposed to the formatted text found in “What You See Is What You Get” word processors like Microsoft Word, LibreOffice Writer and Apple Pages. The writer uses markup tagging conventions to define the general structure of a document to stylise text throughout a document (such as bold and italics), and to add citations and cross-references. A TeX distribution such as TeX Live or MiKTeX is used to produce an output file (such as PDF or DVI) suitable for printing or digital distribution.\nLaTeX is widely used in academia for the communication and publication of scientific documents in many fields, including mathematics, computer science, engineering, physics, chemistry, economics, linguistics, quantitative psychology, philosophy, and political science. It also has a prominent role in the preparation and publication of books and articles that contain complex multilingual materials, such as Sanskrit and Greek. LaTeX uses the TeX typesetting program for formatting its output, and is itself written in the TeX macro language.\nHistory LaTeX was created in the early 1980s by Leslie Lamport, when he was working at SRI. He needed to write TeX macros for his own use, and thought that with a little extra effort he could make a general package usable by others. Peter Gordon, an editor at Addison-Wesley, convinced him to write a LaTeX user’s manual for publication (Lamport was initially skeptical that anyone would pay money for it); it came out in 1986 and sold hundreds of thousands of copies. Meanwhile, Lamport released versions of his LaTeX macros in 1984 and 1985. On 21 August 1989, at a TeX Users Group (TUG) meeting at Stanford, Lamport agreed to turn over maintenance and development of LaTeX to Frank Mittelbach. Mittelbach, along with Chris Rowley and Rainer Schöpf, formed the LaTeX3 team; in 1994, they released LaTeX2e, the current standard version. LaTeX3 itself has since been cancelled with version features intended for that version being back-ported to LaTeX 2e since 2018.\nRelated software As a macro package, LaTeX provides a set of macros for TeX to interpret. There are many other macro packages for TeX, including Plain TeX, GNU Texinfo, AMSTeX, and ConTeXt.\nWhen TeX “compiles” a document, it follows (from the user’s point of view) the following processing sequence: Macros → TeX → Driver → Output. Different implementations of each of these steps are typically available in TeX distributions. Traditional TeX will output a DVI file, which is usually converted to a PostScript file. More recently, Hàn Thế Thành and others have written a new implementation of TeX called pdfTeX, which also outputs to PDF and takes advantage of features available in that format. The XeTeX engine developed by Jonathan Kew, on the other hand, merges modern font technologies and Unicode with TeX.\nThe default font for LaTeX is Knuth’s Computer Modern, which gives default documents created with LaTeX the same distinctive look as those created with plain TeX. XeTeX allows the use of OpenType and TrueType (that is, outlined) fonts for output files.\nThere are also many editors for LaTeX, some of which are offline, source-code-based while others are online, partial-WYSIWYG-based. For more, see Comparison of TeX editors.\n","date":1656087170,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1656087170,"objectID":"48d1feae5c0ec3689da86c8084f7785c","permalink":"https://example.com/post/latex/","publishdate":"2022-06-24T19:12:50+03:00","relpermalink":"/post/latex/","section":"post","summary":"Post about latex","tags":[],"title":"Latex","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"How can you make a good presentation even more effective? This page draws on published advice from expert presenters around the world, which will help to take your presentations from merely ‘good’ to ‘great’.\nBy bringing together advice from a wide range of people, the aim is to cover a whole range of areas.\nWhether you are an experienced presenter, or just starting out, there should be ideas here to help you to improve.\n1 Show your Passion and Connect with your Audience It’s hard to be relaxed and be yourself when you’re nervous.\nBut time and again, the great presenters say that the most important thing is to connect with your audience, and the best way to do that is to let your passion for the subject shine through.\nBe honest with the audience about what is important to you and why it matters.\nBe enthusiastic and honest, and the audience will respond.\n2. Focus on your Audience’s Needs Your presentation needs to be built around what your audience is going to get out of the presentation.\nAs you prepare the presentation, you always need to bear in mind what the audience needs and wants to know, not what you can tell them.\nWhile you’re giving the presentation, you also need to remain focused on your audience’s response, and react to that.\nYou need to make it easy for your audience to understand and respond.\n3. Keep it Simple: Concentrate on your Core Message When planning your presentation, you should always keep in mind the question:\nWhat is the key message (or three key points) for my audience to take away?\nYou should be able to communicate that key message very briefly.\nSome experts recommend a 30-second ‘elevator summary’, others that you can write it on the back of a business card, or say it in no more than 15 words.\nWhichever rule you choose, the important thing is to keep your core message focused and brief.\nAnd if what you are planning to say doesn’t contribute to that core message, don’t say it.\n4. Smile and Make Eye Contact with your Audience This sounds very easy, but a surprisingly large number of presenters fail to do it.\nIf you smile and make eye contact, you are building rapport, which helps the audience to connect with you and your subject. It also helps you to feel less nervous, because you are talking to individuals, not to a great mass of unknown people.\nTo help you with this, make sure that you don’t turn down all the lights so that only the slide screen is visible. Your audience needs to see you as well as your slides.\n5. Start Strongly The beginning of your presentation is crucial. You need to grab your audience’s attention and hold it.\nThey will give you a few minutes’ grace in which to entertain them, before they start to switch off if you’re dull. So don’t waste that on explaining who you are. Start by entertaining them.\nTry a story (see tip 7 below), or an attention-grabbing (but useful) image on a slide.\n6. Remember the 10-20-30 Rule for Slideshows This is a tip from Guy Kawasaki of Apple. He suggests that slideshows should:\nContain no more than 10 slides; Last no more than 20 minutes; and Use a font size of no less than 30 point. This last is particularly important as it stops you trying to put too much information on any one slide. This whole approach avoids the dreaded ‘Death by PowerPoint’.\nAs a general rule, slides should be the sideshow to you, the presenter. A good set of slides should be no use without the presenter, and they should definitely contain less, rather than more, information, expressed simply.\nIf you need to provide more information, create a bespoke handout and give it out after your presentation.\n","date":1656087170,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1656087170,"objectID":"a8785ce9c56ec6256c45c8543ef036cb","permalink":"https://example.com/post/pres/","publishdate":"2022-06-24T19:12:50+03:00","relpermalink":"/post/pres/","section":"post","summary":"Top Tips for Effective Presentations","tags":[],"title":"Presentation","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":" Overview Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.\nPython is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a “batteries included” language due to its comprehensive standard library.\nGuido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0. Python 2.0 was released in 2000 and introduced new features such as list comprehensions, cycle-detecting garbage collection, reference counting, and Unicode support. Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision that is not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions. Python 2 was discontinued with version 2.7.18 in 2020.\nPython consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages.\nHistory Python was conceived in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde \u0026amp; Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC programming language, which was inspired by SETL, capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system.Its implementation began in December 1989. Van Rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018, when he announced his “permanent vacation” from his responsibilities as Python’s “benevolent dictator for life”, a title the Python community bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term commitment as the project’s chief decision-maker. In January 2019, active Python core developers elected a five-member Steering Council to lead the project.\nPython 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000, with many major new features. Python 3.0, released on 3 December 2008, with many of its major features backported to Python 2.6.x and 2.7.x. Releases of Python 3 include the 2to3 utility, which automates the translation of Python 2 code to Python 3.\nPython 2.7’s end-of-life was initially set for 2015, then postponed to 2020 out of concern that a large body of existing code could not easily be forward-ported to Python 3. No further security patches or other improvements will be released for it. With Python 2’s end-of-life, only Python 3.6.x and later were supported. Later, support for 3.6 was also discontinued. In 2021, Python 3.9.2 and 3.8.8 were expedited as all versions of Python (including 2.7) had security issues leading to possible remote code executionand web cache poisoning.\nIn 2022, Python 3.10.4 and 3.9.12 were expedited and so were older releases including 3.8.13, and 3.7.13 because of many security issues in 2022. Python 3.9.13 is the latest 3.9 version, and from now on 3.9 (and older; 3.8 and 3.7) will only get security updates.\nDesign philosophy and features Python is a multi-paradigm programming language. Object-oriented programming and structured programming are fully supported, and many of its features support functional programming and aspect-oriented programming (including metaprogramming and metaobjects [magic methods] ).Many other paradigms are supported via extensions, including design by contract and logic programming.\nPython uses dynamic typing and a combination of reference counting and a cycle-detecting garbage collector for memory management. It uses dynamic name resolution (late binding), which binds method and variable names during program execution.\nIts design offers some support for functional programming in the Lisp tradition. It has filter,mapandreduce functions; list comprehensions, dictionaries, sets, and generator expressions. The standard library has two modules (itertools and functools) that implement functional tools borrowed from Haskell and Standard ML.\nIts core philosophy is summarized in the document The Zen of Python (PEP 20), which includes aphorisms such as:\nBeautiful is better than ugly. Explicit is better than implicit. Simple is better than complex. Complex is better than complicated. Readability counts. Rather than building all of its functionality into its core, Python was designed to be highly extensible via modules. This compact modularity has made it particularly popular as a means of adding programmable interfaces to existing applications. Van Rossum’s vision of a small core language with a large standard library and easily extensible interpreter stemmed from his frustrations with ABC, which espoused the opposite approach.\nPython strives for a simpler, less-cluttered syntax and grammar while giving developers a choice in their coding methodology. In contrast to Perl’s “there is more than one way to do it” motto, Python embraces a “there should be one—and preferably only one—obvious way to do it” philosophy.

The word “project” thus originally meant “before an action”.\nWhen the English language initially adopted the word, it referred to a plan of something, not to the act of actually carrying this plan out. Something performed in accordance with a project became known as an “object”. Every project has certain phases of development.\nBased on the Project Management Institute, a project can be defined as a “temporary endeavor” aimed to drive changes in teams, organizations, or societies. The output of a project is normally a unique product, service, or result.\nSpecific uses School and university A project is an individual or collaborative enterprise that is carefully planned and researched about by students. At schools, educational institutes and universities, a project is a research assignment - given to a student - which generally requires a larger amount of effort and more independent work than that involved in a normal essay assignment. It requires students to undertake their own fact-finding and analysis, either from library/internet research or from gathering data empirically. The written report that comes from the project is usually in the form of a dissertation, which will contain sections on the project’s inception, analysis, findings and conclusions.\nProject management Main article: project management In project management a project consists of a temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service or result. Another definition is: a management environment that is created for the purpose of delivering one or more business products according to a specified business case. Projects can also be seen as temporary organization. Project objectives define target status at the end of the project, reaching of which is considered necessary for the achievement of planned benefits. They can be formulated as SMART criteria: Projects are often guided by a steering group.\nSpecific Measurable (or at least evaluable) achievement Achievable (recently Agreed to or Acceptable are used[by whom?] regularly as well) Realistic (given the current state of organizational resources) Time terminated (bounded) Civil and military construction and industry infrastructure In civil, military and industry (e.g. oil and gas) infrastructure, capital projects refer to activities to construct and install equipment, facilities and buildings. As these activities are temporary endeavors with clear start and end dates, the term “project” is applied. Because the results of these activities are typically long-standing infrastructure, with a life measured in years or decades, these projects are typically accounted for in financial accounting as capital expenditures, and thus they are termed “capital projects”.\nComputer software In computer software, a project can consist of programs, configuration definitions and related data.[citation needed] For example, in Microsoft Visual Studio a “solution” consists of projects and other definitions.\nState project It can be defined as “a set of state policies and/or agencies unified around a particular issue or oppression”. Therefore, these kinds of projects involve constant change and dynamism due to the social constructions evolve among time. State projects have to adapt to the current moment. They are mostly community services based.\n","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"d78b244891a26bbbd74f982a9042c477","permalink":"https://example.com/project/project-1/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/project-1/","section":"project","summary":"An example making project page.","tags":["Deep Learning"],"title":"My Project work","type":"project"},{"authors":["Karim Y.
