&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Git (/ɡɪt/) is software for tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows (thousands of parallel branches running on different systems).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Git was originally authored by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for development of the Linux kernel, with other kernel developers contributing to its initial development. Since 2005, Junio Hamano has been the core maintainer. As with most other distributed version control systems, and unlike most client–server systems, every Git directory on every computer is a full-fledged repository with complete history and full version-tracking abilities, independent of network access or a central server. Git is free and open-source software distributed under the GPL-2.0-only license.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Git development began in April 2005, after many developers of the Linux kernel gave up access to BitKeeper, a proprietary source-control management (SCM) system that they had been using to maintain the project since 2002.The copyright holder of BitKeeper, Larry McVoy, had withdrawn free use of the product after claiming that Andrew Tridgell had created SourcePuller by reverse engineering the BitKeeper protocols.The same incident also spurred the creation of another version-control system, Mercurial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linus Torvalds wanted a distributed system that he could use like BitKeeper, but none of the available free systems met his needs. Torvalds cited an example of a source-control management system needing 30 seconds to apply a patch and update all associated metadata, and noted that this would not scale to the needs of Linux kernel development, where synchronizing with fellow maintainers could require 250 such actions at once. For his design criterion, he specified that patching should take no more than three seconds, and added three more goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;design&#34;&gt;Design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Git&amp;rsquo;s design was inspired by BitKeeper and Monotone. Git was originally designed as a low-level version-control system engine, on top of which others could write front ends, such as Cogito or StGIT.The core Git project has since become a complete version-control system that is usable directly. While strongly influenced by BitKeeper, Torvalds deliberately avoided conventional approaches, leading to a unique design.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LaTeX (/ˈlɑːtɛx/ LAH-tekh or /ˈleɪtɛx/ LAY-tekh, is a software system for document preparation. When writing, the writer uses plain text as opposed to the formatted text found in &amp;ldquo;What You See Is What You Get&amp;rdquo; word processors like Microsoft Word, LibreOffice Writer and Apple Pages. The writer uses markup tagging conventions to define the general structure of a document to stylise text throughout a document (such as bold and italics), and to add citations and cross-references. A TeX distribution such as TeX Live or MiKTeX is used to produce an output file (such as PDF or DVI) suitable for printing or digital distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LaTeX is widely used in academia for the communication and publication of scientific documents in many fields, including mathematics, computer science, engineering, physics, chemistry, economics, linguistics, quantitative psychology, philosophy, and political science. It also has a prominent role in the preparation and publication of books and articles that contain complex multilingual materials, such as Sanskrit and Greek. LaTeX uses the TeX typesetting program for formatting its output, and is itself written in the TeX macro language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LaTeX was created in the early 1980s by Leslie Lamport, when he was working at SRI. He needed to write TeX macros for his own use, and thought that with a little extra effort he could make a general package usable by others. Peter Gordon, an editor at Addison-Wesley, convinced him to write a LaTeX user&amp;rsquo;s manual for publication (Lamport was initially skeptical that anyone would pay money for it); it came out in 1986 and sold hundreds of thousands of copies. Meanwhile, Lamport released versions of his LaTeX macros in 1984 and 1985. On 21 August 1989, at a TeX Users Group (TUG) meeting at Stanford, Lamport agreed to turn over maintenance and development of LaTeX to Frank Mittelbach. Mittelbach, along with Chris Rowley and Rainer Schöpf, formed the LaTeX3 team; in 1994, they released LaTeX2e, the current standard version. LaTeX3 itself has since been cancelled with version features intended for that version being back-ported to LaTeX 2e since 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;related-software&#34;&gt;Related software&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a macro package, LaTeX provides a set of macros for TeX to interpret. There are many other macro packages for TeX, including Plain TeX, GNU Texinfo, AMSTeX, and ConTeXt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When TeX &amp;ldquo;compiles&amp;rdquo; a document, it follows (from the user&amp;rsquo;s point of view) the following processing sequence: Macros → TeX → Driver → Output. Different implementations of each of these steps are typically available in TeX distributions. Traditional TeX will output a DVI file, which is usually converted to a PostScript file. More recently, Hàn Thế Thành and others have written a new implementation of TeX called pdfTeX, which also outputs to PDF and takes advantage of features available in that format. The XeTeX engine developed by Jonathan Kew, on the other hand, merges modern font technologies and Unicode with TeX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The default font for LaTeX is Knuth&amp;rsquo;s Computer Modern, which gives default documents created with LaTeX the same distinctive look as those created with plain TeX. XeTeX allows the use of OpenType and TrueType (that is, outlined) fonts for output files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also many editors for LaTeX, some of which are offline, source-code-based while others are online, partial-WYSIWYG-based. For more, see Comparison of TeX editors.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Presentation</title>
      <link>https://example.com/post/pres/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 24 Jun 2022 19:12:50 +0300</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/post/pres/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-can-you-make-a-good-presentation-even-more-effective&#34;&gt;How can you make a good presentation even more effective?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This page draws on published advice from expert presenters around the world, which will help to take your presentations from merely ‘good’ to ‘great’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By bringing together advice from a wide range of people, the aim is to cover a whole range of areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you are an experienced presenter, or just starting out, there should be ideas here to help you to improve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-show-your-passion-and-connect-with-your-audience&#34;&gt;1 Show your Passion and Connect with your Audience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to be relaxed and be yourself when you’re nervous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But time and again, the great presenters say that the most important thing is to connect with your audience, and the best way to do that is to let your passion for the subject shine through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be honest with the audience about what is important to you and why it matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be enthusiastic and honest, and the audience will respond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;2-focus-on-your-audiences-needs&#34;&gt;2. Focus on your Audience’s Needs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your presentation needs to be built around what your audience is going to get out of the presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you prepare the presentation, you always need to bear in mind what the audience needs and wants to know, not what you can tell them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While you’re giving the presentation, you also need to remain focused on your audience’s response, and react to that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need to make it easy for your audience to understand and respond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;3-keep-it-simple-concentrate-on-your-core-message&#34;&gt;3. Keep it Simple: Concentrate on your Core Message&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When planning your presentation, you should always keep in mind the question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the key message (or three key points) for my audience to take away?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should be able to communicate that key message very briefly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some experts recommend a 30-second ‘elevator summary’, others that you can write it on the back of a business card, or say it in no more than 15 words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whichever rule you choose, the important thing is to keep your core message focused and brief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if what you are planning to say doesn’t contribute to that core message, don’t say it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;4-smile-and-make-eye-contact-with-your-audience&#34;&gt;4. Smile and Make Eye Contact with your Audience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sounds very easy, but a surprisingly large number of presenters fail to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you smile and make eye contact, you are building rapport, which helps the audience to connect with you and your subject. It also helps you to feel less nervous, because you are talking to individuals, not to a great mass of unknown people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help you with this, make sure that you don’t turn down all the lights so that only the slide screen is visible. Your audience needs to see you as well as your slides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;5-start-strongly&#34;&gt;5. Start Strongly&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beginning of your presentation is crucial. You need to grab your audience’s attention and hold it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They will give you a few minutes’ grace in which to entertain them, before they start to switch off if you’re dull. So don’t waste that on explaining who you are. Start by entertaining them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try a story (see tip 7 below), or an attention-grabbing (but useful) image on a slide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;6-remember-the-10-20-30-rule-for-slideshows&#34;&gt;6. Remember the 10-20-30 Rule for Slideshows&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a tip from Guy Kawasaki of Apple. He suggests that slideshows should:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contain no more than 10 slides;
Last no more than 20 minutes; and
Use a font size of no less than 30 point.
This last is particularly important as it stops you trying to put too much information on any one slide. This whole approach avoids the dreaded ‘Death by PowerPoint’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a general rule, slides should be the sideshow to you, the presenter. A good set of slides should be no use without the presenter, and they should definitely contain less, rather than more, information, expressed simply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you need to provide more information, create a bespoke handout and give it out after your presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
